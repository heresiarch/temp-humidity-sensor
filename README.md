# RFM69 Moteino based Temperature and Humidity based Sensor
This is an example project of an ultra low power Temperature and Humidity 868Mhz wireless device with the [Moteino platform](https://lowpowerlab.com/guide/moteino/) and BME280 or SHT31 I2C sensors. 
They could run 4-5 years with a battery and reporting rate of 10 minutes. 
The average power consumption is lower than the self discharge of the batteries. The compagnion project is this [RFM69/ESP32 based MQTT Gateway](https://github.com/heresiarch/RFM69-ESP32-Gateway).
